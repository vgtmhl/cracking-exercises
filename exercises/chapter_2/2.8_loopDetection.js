/**
 * Given a list which might contain a loop, return the node at the beginning of the loop
 * 
 * Trivial: just keep a set of visited nodes. 
 * Iterate through the list. If we reach a node that has already been visited, then we know there is a loop 
 * 
 * The book also proposes a solution with slow runner vs fast runner which is less trivial.
